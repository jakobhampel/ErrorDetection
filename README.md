The idea behind the implementation is the variation n-gram approach for dependency annotation by:(br>)

The program can be executed by running error_detection.py. This will detect 1 variation nucleus in the example database, containing 2 sentences from the Tüba-D/Z treebank, and store them in ´data/variationNuclei.json´ .

Please note that, due to copyright reasons, the actual treebank containing more than 100,000 sentences is not uploaded here.
